Hi everyone! Whenever someone asks me a question or brings up an interesting topic I like to follow-up with some notes on the subject, which I have collected here.

Please note that this material **is not** part of the Techtonica curriculum and may offer a different perspective. If you are currently enrolled in one of Techtonica's excellent programs I encourage you to use these notes only as supplemental reference, and always prioritize content in the official curriculum.

Feel free to point out any corrections or improvements by opening an issue.
